# drupal-docker-base

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/digdep/drupal-base/)

This is a base image for running Drupal 8 in development. It does not come with Drupal itself, but it does come with a properly configured NGINX, PHP-FPM, Composer, and Drush, and the dependencies required for using it as an image on the CircleCI 2.0 platform.

See `docker-compose.example.yml` for how to use.
